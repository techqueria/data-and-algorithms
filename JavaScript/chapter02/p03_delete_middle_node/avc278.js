// Delete Middle Node: Implement an algorithm to delete a node in the middle (i.e. any node but the first and last node,
// not necessarily the exact middle) of a singly linked list, given only access to that node.
// EXAMPLE:
// Input: the node c from the linked list a => b => c => d => e => f
// Result: nothing is returned, but the new linked list looks like a => b => d => e => f

 * There's no trick to this problem. We know that a linked list, fundamentally, is just a collection of nodes with
 * values that point to another node. We don't need to necessarily delete the selected node. We just need to overwrite
 * what that node represents. In other words, we can overwrite the next node onto the current node, then skip from the
 * current node to the next next node, effectively skipping over the node after the selected node since it's redundant.
 * Runtime: O(1)
 * Space:   O(1)
